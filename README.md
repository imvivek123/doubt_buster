# Doubt Busters - Software Engineering Project
This is the github repository of our Doubt Forum project - Doubt Busters. 
In the project, the user can signup and login using his mail and password and then he can post his/her doubts according to the subject tags and answer other's doubts. The user can also access all the questions that he asked in his personal dashboard. 
The questions are stored in a database which can be searched through the search bar and can be filtered using tags, in a reverse chronological order of the time when it was posted. A user can also reply to the answer of any question and delete it in case of any errors. 
The website is built using modern front-end technologies such as React Js and CSS, which provide an intuitive and responsive user experience. We have also used the Firebase technologies to store user data and enable real-time updates of the forum's content.
